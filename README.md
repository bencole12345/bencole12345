### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Ben (he/him/his), a software engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.

Like most engineers, I enjoy writing code and solving problems. I've pinned a few of the projects that I have worked on - take a look! I'm particularly proud of [JavAssembler](https://github.com/bencole12345/JavAssembler), the compiler that I wrote for my Bachelor's project, and [Capability-Derived Lifetimes](https://github.com/bencole12345/CapabilityDerivedLifetimes), an ISA extension I developed to prevent stack-based temporal memory safety violations.
