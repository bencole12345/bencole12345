### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Ben (he/him), a fourth-year student studying for a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, UK.

Like most CompScis, I enjoy writing code and solving problems. I've pinned a few of the projects that I have worked on - take a look! I'm particularly proud of [JavAssembler](https://github.com/bencole12345/JavAssembler), the compiler that I wrote for my Bachelor's project. You can read my dissertation [here](https://github.com/bencole12345/JavAssembler/blob/master/Dissertation.pdf).

- ðŸ˜„ Hobbies: Video Games, Chess, Cycling, Badminton
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: C++, and want to discover more about lower-level programming.
- ðŸ“š Currently reading: Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann, and The Void Trilogy by Peter F. Hamilton.
<!-- - âš¡ Fun fact: In term-time I start my days at 6am! -->
